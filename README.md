# Greek New Testament Vocabulary Dataset

This repository provides structured Greek New Testament vocabulary data
designed for learners, teachers, and researchers.

The dataset is derived from interlinear Greek NT sources and is published
as clean, UTF-8 CSV files suitable for spreadsheets, flashcards, and
computational analysis.

## Dataset Variants

Four complementary datasets are provided:

1. **Reading Order – Unique Forms**
   - Unique Greek word forms ordered by first occurrence using the
     Greek for Life recommended reading sequence.

2. **Reading Order – All Occurrences**
   - All word occurrences ordered by the same reading sequence.

3. **Canonical Order – Unique Forms**
   - Unique Greek word forms ordered by first occurrence in the
     traditional New Testament order.

4. **Canonical Order – All Occurrences**
   - Complete corpus ordered canonically, preserving repetition.

## Columns

Each CSV uses the following schema:

- `greek_word`
- `english_translation`
- `parsing_abbreviation`
- `strongs_number`
- `chapter_ref`

## Encoding

All files are encoded as **UTF-8 with BOM** to ensure compatibility with
Excel, LibreOffice, and flashcard software.
