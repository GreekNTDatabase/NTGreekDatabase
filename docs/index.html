  <h1>Greek New Testament Vocabulary</h1>

  <p>
    Clean, structured Greek New Testament vocabulary datasets for study,
    flashcards, and research.
  </p>

  <h2>About This Project</h2>

  <p>
    This project began as a personal learning tool while studying New Testament
    Greek. I wanted a simple, repeatable way to build and maintain vocabulary
    flashcards directly from the text—without manually copying words, losing
    context, or relying on proprietary software.
  </p>

  <p>
    To solve this, I built a complete Greek New Testament vocabulary database for
    my own study and uploads. Once the dataset was complete, stable, and internally
    consistent, I decided to publish it openly so others could benefit from the
    same workflow.
  </p>

  <p>
    One set of datasets follows the reading order recommended in
    <strong><em>Greek for Life: Strategies for Learning, Retaining, and Reviving New Testament Greek</em></strong>
    by Jonathan T. Pennington.

  <h2>How to Use These Files</h2>

  <p>
    These CSV files are designed to be imported directly into spreadsheet
    software or flashcard applications. Many learners use the
    <strong>Unique Forms</strong> datasets to generate vocabulary decks while
    reading the text in sequence.
  </p>

  <p>
    The <strong>All Occurrences</strong> datasets preserve repetition and are
    useful for studying frequency, reinforcement patterns, or for computational
    analysis.
