<h2>About This Project</h2>

<p>
This project began as a personal learning tool while studying New Testament Greek.
I wanted a simple, repeatable way to build and maintain vocabulary flashcards
directly from the text—without manually copying words, losing context, or relying
on proprietary software.
</p>

<p>
To solve this, I built a complete Greek New Testament vocabulary database for my
own study and uploads. Once the dataset was complete, stable, and internally
consistent, I decided to publish it openly so others could benefit from the same
workflow.
</p>

<p>
One set of datasets follows the reading order recommended in
<strong><em>Greek for Life: Strategies for Learning, Retaining, and Reviving New Testament Greek</em></strong>
by Jonathan T. Pennington.
